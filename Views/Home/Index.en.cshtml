            This site is meant to showcase me and my career as a software developer.
            Several of my software projects that I've developed over the years are listed here: like this site for example!
            It's available on <a href="https://github.com/johqva93/JohannesQvarford.Website">Github</a>.
            Take a look around and see what you think.
